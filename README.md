# Solar-Power-Generation-Forecasting-Using-ML
Built a regression-based forecasting model using Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM to
predict solar AC power from sensor data. Performed EDA, feature engineering (lag/rolling/time
features), preprocessing, and hyperparameter tuning; achieved high accuracy (R² ≈ 0.9998) with
Random Forest as the best model.
